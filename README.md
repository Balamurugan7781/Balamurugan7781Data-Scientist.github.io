Fake Loan Prediction using Machine Learning Algortihm:
-- In this project, a ML model is developed using various Machine Learning Algorithms.
-- Naive Bayes gives better accuracy as compared to other supervised and unsupervised ML Algorithms.
-- Webpage development is currently in progress 
-- The best model is implemented in website with the help of Flask and pickle.

Rainfall Prediction using IBM Watson - Applied Data Science:
-- ML model is developed to predict Rainfall for Specific Areas.
-- RandomForestClassifier gives better accuracy compared to other algorithms.
-- A website was developed using Flask and IBM Cloud.

Cardiac Arrythmia Multi Class Classification:
-- Implemented Bagging and Boosting Methods for the first time.
-- RandomForestClassifier gives better accuracy.

Algorthmic Analysis of Web Crawlers- Data Structures:
-- Here, we used to collect the words from every websites.
-- Starting from the root URL, the crawler will fetch web pages and find other URLs to visit, called seeds.
-- All seeds found on this project will be added on list of URLs visited.
-- Web Crawling allows us to visit pages present on root page, with possibility of excluding some pages. 
-- Here, we have implemented 5 algorithms namely, BFS, DFS, PageRank Algorithm, Online Page Importance Calculation Algorithm and Focused Crawling Algorithm.
